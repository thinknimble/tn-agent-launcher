Lets create the UI for our feature

We want users to be able to create new agent projects from their dashboard 
An agent project consists of one or many agent instances 
An agent instance is connected to one or many prompts that are only available to that agent. 

Users bring their own api key
if the selected provider is ollama a user can either add an api_key or provide a target_url

You can checkout the src/services/agent-project and src/services/agent-instance for details
